# 📊 Analyzing Data Science Skill Demand Using Google Trends

## Overview
This project analyzes global Google search trends to understand how demand for
Data Scientist roles compares with interest in AI tools and Machine Learning learning paths.

The goal is to identify skill-first hiring signals using real-world data.

## Data Source
- Google Trends (PyTrends API)
- Timeframe: Past 5 years
- Data Type: Normalized search interest (0–100)

## Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- PyTrends
- Statsmodels
- Scikit-learn

## Key Analysis
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Trend smoothing
- Time-series decomposition
- Growth and lead–lag analysis
- Short-horizon forecasting (ARIMA)

## Key Insights
- AI tools show sustained growth relative to job-title searches
- Learning demand often precedes hiring interest
- Indicates a shift toward skill-first hiring

## Why This Project Matters

Rather than focusing only on job titles, this analysis highlights how
skill demand (AI tools, ML learning) evolves relative to hiring interest.
Such signals can help organizations, educators, and job seekers
anticipate market shifts earlier.

## Limitations
- Google Trends data is sampled and normalized
- Search interest does not equal hiring volume
- External events are not captured

## Conclusion
Understanding skill demand trends can help job seekers, educators,
and organizations make informed decisions in a rapidly evolving job market.
